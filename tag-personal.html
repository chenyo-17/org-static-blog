            Over the past years, I&rsquo;ve been involved in organizing and
            monitoring four exams. Yesterday marked my fourth and likely final
            exam monitoring session for the foreseeable future. Now seems like
            an opportune moment to reflect on my exam organization journey.

            My first exam experience was relatively straightforward. As I was
            unfamiliar with the exam content, my primary responsibility was
            taking students to the restrooms. I recall accompanying nearly 10
            students during the session. For the remainder of the time, I sat at
            the back of the room, occupying myself with some drawing.

          <p>
            This exam was identical to the first, but I was tasked with
            designing a significant portion of the questions. Initially,
            formulating questions seemed straightforward, but I later realized
            my inability to create effective ones. My first draft incorporated
            connections between various questions. During the review process, I
            was advised to maximize information density in questions, as
            stressed students prefer concise text. Additional challenges emerged
            when I began grading the exams. For example, open-ended questions
            consistently yielded unexpected answers, requiring me to modify the
            grading scheme while maintaining consistency with previous
            assessments.
          </p>

          <p>
            The exam monitoring this time was more demanding as I began
            responding to student inquiries. My limited knowledge of the entire
            exam often required me to seek assistance from colleagues, and
            occasionally I struggled to comprehend the questions.
          </p>

          <p>
            Grading the exam proved to be the most challenging aspect of the
            process. Evaluating over 100 exams, deciphering handwriting,
            determining fair point allocations, and recording scores was an
            incredibly tedious task. Unlike traditional mathematics exams that
            focus primarily on calculations, our exam encouraged creative
            thinking. Each answer contained implicit assumptions about the
            question, requiring careful interpretation to avoid excessive point
            deductions. The process was extremely time-consuming and offered
            minimal personal benefit or satisfaction.

            This was a different exam, where I again designed one part and
            monitored its administration. Fortunately, due to its advanced
            nature, few students registered for this exam. This time, I had the
            privilege of collaborating with exceptional colleagues. Despite
            these advantages, the design process still demanded considerable
            effort on my part.
          </p>

          <p>
            A unique aspect of this exam was that I also developed the course
            material, as it was a newly introduced subject. The topic proved
            challenging, and the exercises were demanding. Students expressed
            concerns about the complexity of the material. Consequently, we
            faced the task of devising ways to simplify the exam questions
            without compromising their effectiveness.

            Now comes the most recent exam, where I took on the role of a
            coordinator. This position entailed not only designing my portion of
            the tasks but also finding colleagues to design other tasks,
            managing the timeline, reviewing drafts, printing exams,
            coordinating exam monitoring, and overseeing the grading process.
            Fortunately, I had the support of proactive and helpful colleagues,
            which allowed everything to proceed smoothly.
          </p>

          <p>
            The monitoring process proved particularly demanding this time. As I
            was now familiar with the entire exam, I was responsible for reading
            instructions, making announcements, and answering as many questions
            as possible. I had to arrive at the exam rooms by 8 AM, forgoing
            breakfast, and remained standing and focused until noon. In
            retrospect, I may have been overly diligent due to inexperience and
            could have perhaps allowed myself to relax more. However, I&rsquo;ll
            never know for certain, as this marks the conclusion of my exam
            organization duties.
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, not quite the end, as I still need to complete the grading and
            submit the results.

          <p>
            After four instances of exam organization experience, I must admit
            that I do not recommend it. This opinion is, of course, highly
            personal, as I am not particularly inclined towards teaching. From
            my perspective, it is a job that demands significant effort while
            offering minimal returns. I can confidently say that I invest more
            time in the exam process than any individual student taking it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The process of designing and grading exams presents a complex
            optimization challenge. There&rsquo;s an inverse relationship
            between the time spent on design and the time required for grading.
            The less effort put into crafting the exam, the more time-consuming
            the grading process becomes. Moreover, it&rsquo;s disheartening to
            spend two full days meticulously designing and reviewing a question,
            only to have it attempted by a mere handful of students.

      </h1>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to document my experience in my
        German course. Now, having completed the first month, there
        couldn&rsquo;t be a better time to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I approached the course with some dissatisfaction. The pace
        felt too slow, and I was critical of my teacher&rsquo;s methods. Boredom
        and impatience set in as I waited for others to catch up.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then I began interacting with my classmates, and I had the chance to
        hear a different world.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first people I met was a talkative Ukrainian woman. When she
        is not satisfied with something, she interrupts and shouts. She knows a
        lot about healthcare, and she told me this and that about refugee
        polices. I admire her enviable energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first walked in the classroom, I noticed a young man who already
        spoke rapid German. I asked him how he did it and he said since he
        started learning German four months ago, he only spoke German. He is
        smart and also speaks English, Turkish and Afghanistan. His experience
        reminds me a lot of the book &ldquo;The New Odyssey&rdquo;, and I am
        curious about more of his stories. He is only 19 years old, I believe a
        bright future awaits him.

        The man sitting next to me has a political asylum visa. He was a
        political journalist not welcomed by the government. He said so he lived
        at the borderline for many years before he came here. He is no longer
        young and it was his second time to take the same course. He has a
        beautiful handwriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another young man I know a bit comes from Latin America, he often dozes
        off in the class due to his Uber delivery job. I also met a young lady
        from Turkey, she is so charming with a wonderful personality. There are
        also two resilient mothers who undertake childcare with their studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last week I finally got to know my teacher a bit. He told us he
        worked 220 hours a month at the moment so that he can pay his expense
        for he and his girlfriend, and he used to work even more. He said he had
        different trainings in different countries, and now he finally got a new
        passport. He shared with us different information that help foreigners
        maintain a basic life here.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, I still think the course is too easy for me, who has spent
        twenty years staying in schools. But I wish I had talked more with
        everyone about their lives. So many people come here, and each finds
        their own way to stay and live. Life is always hard but also incredible,
        and I wish I don&rsquo;t ever forget it.

            Ich habe seit diesem Montag einen intensiven Deutschkurs gemacht.
            Die Kurs fangt von 8:30 Uhr bis 11:45 Uhr jeden Tag an. Weil von
            mein Wohnung bis zu die Schule ich fast einen Stunden brauche, muss
            ich vor 7 aufstehen und zur Bushaltstelle runnen. Nach dem Kurs
            fahre ich mit dem Bus zur Buro und arbeite ich bis zum Abendessen.
            Danach komme ich nach Haus zuruck und mache ein paar Haushalt. Ich
            gehe circa 11 Uhr ins Bett.

            This is interesting, I am still in the starting phase, I cannot
            speak fluently at all and I have grammar mistakes everywhere.
            However, now when I try to type something in english, the german
            translation pops up in my mind first. If I don&rsquo;t know the
            german, I have a problem writing it down in english. As a result, my
            written english falls back to almost the same level as german.

            All my classmates come from diverse backgrounds. At least 5 are
            Ukriainian, and at least 2 from some countries that I have never
            heard before. English is no longer a universal language, but with my
            broken german I can barely chat.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even with english, I have struggled a lot introducing myself. In the
            past decade, I never had this issue since everyone around me shared
            the similar experience. I can easily position myself; which
            education I had, which university I went, what work I am doing, what
            issue I have, etc. But this coordinate system works no more in this
            class. I am only confusing others if I mention I am a PhD student.
            So you are a student, they ask, why would they pay a student?
          </p>

          <p>
            Once I asked classmate what she does on weekend. She paused, and
            said: because you are working, so the weekend is different for you,
            but I don&rsquo;t work, so there is no difference for me. And before
            this I have never thought of such a bias in my question.
          </p>

          <p>
            More and more often recently, I realize how limited my perspective
            is. I did not know what the life with a social worker is like. I did
            not know that Afghan can often speak Turkish. I did not know what my
            lecturer thinks when he works as a security guard at night. I have
            been too much caught up in my own world, such that I am unable to
            ask a meaningful question of people I don&rsquo;t understand. I want
            to know more about the difference of this world, but I don&rsquo;t
            know how.

              We first went a tour in Aareschlucht, where we experienced both
              strong cold wind and gentle warm wind.
            </li>
            <li>
              We then did a half-hour small hiking to go back to our starting

            <li>
              Then we drove to Brienz, and had a relaxing lunch along the lake,
              where I ate a piece of watermelon.

              We took the 1-hour steam train to the Rothorn Kulm, when we
              arrived it started to be foggy, windy and rainy.

            <li>
              We refilled our energy with hot drinks and snacks in the
              restaurant, and took a short stroll around the restaurant.
            </li>
            <li>
              We went back to the restaurant to escape the cold (yes it is end
              of June) and waited for the steam train to go down.
            </li>
            <li>
              During the train down the sun came out a bit, and the view was
              clear and nice again!

            This week, I found myself craving a movie with a
            &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo; theme. Then the name of Argo came to me. I
            saw its name a decade ago (I am too old!) on some movie magazine
            cover.

        <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
          <p>
            It has little thing to do with &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo;. Instead, it
            blends action, comedy and drama based on a true story, although non
            of any dramatic conflicts really happened in history afak. It is
            about how a selfless agent, backed by an entire intelligence system
            which behaved incredibly efficient, and an alliance which also
            behaved incredibly generous, escaped a group of compatriots, who
            also behaved incredibly brave, from a dangerous place. My boyfriend
            said it is quite &ldquo;Hitchcock&rdquo;. Every tension resolves
            safely in the end: the phone will be picked up at the last second,
            the plane will take off at the last second, even the plane tickets
            will magically show up at the last second (Swissair yeah!).

            I guess? The filming is good, as well as the narration and the
            performance. There were some moments where I was not fully
            convinced, but I accept them if that was the history. What really
            amazed me was when I found the actor of Tony was also the director,
            and also wrote &ldquo;Good Will Hunting (1997)&rdquo;, what a
            genius! But I guessed I preferred &ldquo;Civil war (2024)&rdquo; (my
            last movie) to this one. The reason? I felt &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; could
            have delved deeper into the absurdities of war rather than solely
            focusing on a heroic narrative.
