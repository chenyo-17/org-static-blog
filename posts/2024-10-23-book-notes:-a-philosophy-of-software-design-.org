This is a personal note for the book "A Philosophy of Software Design" (2018, John Ousterhout).

* Introduction
- The most fundamental problem in CS is **problem decomposition**: how to divide a complex problem into pieces that can be solved independently.
- Complexity increases **inevitably** over the life of the program, but simpler designs allow to build larger systems before complexity becomes overwhelming.
- Two general approaches:
  - Making code more obvious, e.g., eliminating special cases, using identifiers in a consistent fashion.
  - Encapsulate the complexity, i.e., divide a system into independent modules.
- Waterfall model: each phase of a project e.g., requirement, design, coding, testing, completes before the next phase starts, such that the entire system is designed once.
  - Does not work for software since the problem of the initial design do not become apparent until implementation is well underway; then the developers need to patch around the problems, resulting in an explosion of complexity.
- Agile/Incremental development: in each iteration the design focuses on a small subset of the overall functionality, so that problems can be fixed when the system is small and later features benefit from previous experience.
  - Developers should always think about design issues and complexity, and use complexity to guide the design.

* Complexity
- Complexity is **incremental**.
- Developers must adopt a **zero tolerance** philosophy.

** Definition
- Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.
- \(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\): The overall complexity  is determined by the complexity of each part \(p\) weighted by the fraction of time developers working on that part.
  - Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is as good as eliminating the complexity.
- Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers: if you write a piece of code that seems simple to you, but others think it is complex, then it is complex.

** Symptoms
- Change amplification: a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places.
- Cognitive load: developers have to spend more time learning the required information to complete a task, which leads to greater risk of bugs.
  - E.g., a function allocates memory and returns a pointer to the memory, but assumes the caller should free the memory.
  - Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler as it reduces cognitive load.
- Unknown unknowns (the worst!): it is not obvious which pieces of code must be modified or which information must have to complete the task.
- The goal of a good design is for a system to be **obvious**: a developer can make a quick guess about what to do and yet to be confident that the guess is correct.

** Causes
- Complexity is caused by two things: **dependencies** and **obscurity**.
- A dependency exists when a code cannot be understood and modified in isolation.
  - E.g., in network protocols both senders and receivers must conform to the protocol, changing code for the sender almost always requires corresponding changes at the receiver.
  - Dependencies are fundamental and cannot be completely eliminated, the goal is to make the dependencies remain simple and obvious (e.g., variable renaming are detected by compilers).
- Obscurity occurs when important information is not obvious, e.g., a variable is too generic or the documentation is inadequate.
  - Obscurity is often associated with non-obvious dependencies.
  - Inconsistency is also a major contributor, e.g., the same variable name is used for two different purposes.
  - The need for extensive documentation is often a red flag that the design is complex.
- Dependencies lead to change amplification and cognitive load; obscurity creates unknown unknowns and cognitive load.

* Programming mindsets
- Tactical programming: the main focus is to get something working, e.g., a new feature or a bug fix.
- Tactical programming is short-sighted, e.g., each task contributes a reasonable compromise to finish the current task quickly.
- Once a code base turns to spaghetti, it is nearly impossible to fix.

** Strategic programming
- Requires an investment mindset to improve the system design rather than taking the fastest path to finish the current task.
- Proactive investment: try a couple of alternative designs and pick the cleanest one; imagine a few ways in which the system might need to be changed in the future; write documentation.
- Reactive investments: continuously make small improvements to the system design when a design problem becomes obvious rather than patching around it.
- The ideal design tends to emerge in bits and pieces, thus the best approach is to make lots of **small** investments on a **continual** basis, e.g., 10-20% of total development time on investments.

* Modular design
- The goal of modular design is to minimize the dependencies between modules.
- Each module consists of two parts: interface and implementation. The interface describes what the module does, the implementation specifies how it does.
  - The interface consists of everything that a developer working on a different module must know in order to use the given module.
  - The implementation consists of the code that carries out the promises made by the interface.
- The best modules are **deep**, i.e., those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations.
  - In such cases the modification in the implementation is less likely to affect other modules.
- Small modules tend to be shallow, because the benefit they provide is negated by the cost of learning and using their interfaces.
- Classitis refers to a mistaken view that developers should minimize the amount of functionality in each new class.
  - It may result in classes that are individually simple, but increases the overall complexity.

** Interface
- A module interface contains two information: formal and informal.
- The formal part for a method is its signature; The formal interface for a class consists of the signatures for all public methods and variables.
- The informal part includes its high-level behavior and usage constraints; they can only be described using comments and cannot be ensured by the programming languages.
  - Informal aspects are larger and more complex than the formal aspects for most interfaces.
- While providing choice is good, interfaces should be designed to make the **common case** as simple as possible (c.f. \(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\)).

** Abstraction
- An abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which omits unimportant details.
  - The more unimportant details that are omitted from an abstraction, the better, otherwise the abstraction increases the cognitive load.
  - A detail can only be omitted if it is unimportant, otherwise obscurity occurs.
- In modular programming, each module provides an abstraction in form of its interface.
- The key to designing abstractions is to understand what is important.
  - E.g., how to choose storage blocks for a file is unimportant to users, but the rules for flushing data to secondary storage is important for databases, hence it must be visible in the file system interface.
  - Garbage collectors in Go and Java do not have interface at all.

* Information hiding
- Information hiding is the most important technique for achieving deep modules.
- Each module should encapsulate a few design information (e.g., data structures, low-level details) in the module implementation but not appear in its interface.
- Information hiding simplifies the module interface and makes it easier to evolve the system as a design change related a hidden information only affects that module.
- Making an item ~private~ is not the same as information hiding, as the information about the private items can still be exposed through public methods such as ~getter~ and ~setter~.
- If a particular information is only needed by a few of a class's users, it can be **partially** hidden if it is accessed through separate methods, so that it is still invisible in the most common use cases.
  - E.g., modules should provide adequate **defaults** and only callers that want to override the default need to be aware of the parameter.

** Information leakage
- The leakage occurs when a design decision is reflected in multiple modules. thus creating dependencies between the modules.
  - Interface information is by definition has been leaked.
- Information can be leaked even if it does not appear in the interface, i.e., back-door leakage.
  - E.g., two classes read and write the same file format, then if the format changes, both classes need to be modified; such leakage is more pernicious than interface leakage as it is not obvious.
- If affected classes are relatively small and closely tied to the leaked information, they may need to be **merged** into a single class.
  - The bigger class is deeper as the entire computation is easier to be abstracted in the interface compared to separate sub-computations.
- One may also pull the leaked information out of all affected classes and create a new class to encapsulate the information, i.e., replace back-door leakage with interface leakage.
- One should avoid exposing internal data structures (e.g., return by reference) as such approach makes more work for callers, and make the module shallow.
  - E.g., instead of writing ~getParams()~ which returns a map of all parameters, one should have ~getParameter(String name)~ and ~getIntParameter(String name)~ to return a specific parameter and throw an exception if the name does not exist or cannot be converted.

** Temporal decomposition
- Temporal decomposition is a common cause of information leakage.
- It decompose the system into operations corresponding to the execution order.
  - E.g., A file-reading application is broken into 3 classes: read, modify and write, then both reading and writing steps have knowledge about the file format.
  - The solution is to combine the core mechanisms for reading and writing into a single class.
- Orders should not be reflected in the module structure unless different stages use totally different information.
- One should focus on the **knowledge** needed to perform each task, not the order in which tasks occur.

* General-Purpose modules
- General-purpose modules can be used to address a broad range of problems such that it may find unanticipated uses in the future (cf. investment mindset).
- Special-purpose modules are specialized for today's needs, and can be refactored to make it general-purpose when additional uses are required (cf. incremental software development).
- The author recommends a "somewhat general-purpose" fashion: the functionality should reflect the current needs, but the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses.
- The following questions can be asked to find the balance between general-purpose and special-purpose approach:
  - What is the simplest interface that will cover all current needs?
  - How many situations will a method be used?
  - Is the API easy to use for the current needs (not go too far)?

** Example: GUI text editor design
- Specialized design: use individual method in the text class to support each high-level features, e.g., ~backspace(Cursor cursor)~ deletes the character before the cursor; ~delete(Cursor cursor)~ deletes the character after the cursor; ~deleteSelection(Selection selection)~ deletes the selected section.
- The specialized design creates a high cognitive load for the UI developers: the implementation ends up with a large number of shallow methods so a UI developer had to learn all of them.
  - E.g., ~backspace~ provides a false abstraction as it does not hide the information about which character to delete.
- The specialized design also creates information leakage: abstractions related to the UI such as backspace key and selection, are reflected in the text class, increasing the cognitive load for the text class developers.
- General-purpose design define API only in terms of **basic** text features without reflecting the higher-level operations.
  - Only three methods are needed to modify a text: ~insert(Position position, String newText)~,  ~delete(Position start, Position end)~ and ~changePosition(Position position, int numChars)~.
    - The new API uses a more generic ~Position~ to replace a specific user interface ~Cursor~.
    - The delete key can be implemented as ~text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, 1))~, the backspace key can be implemented as ~text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, -1))~.
- The new design is more obvious, e.g., the UI developer knows which character to delete from the interface, and also has less code overall.
- The general-purpose methods can also be used for new feature, e.g., search and replace text.

* Layers of abstractions
- Software systems are composed into layers, where higher layers use the facilities provided by lower layers; each layer provides an abstraction different from the layers above or below it.
  - E.g., a file in the uppermost layer is an array of bytes and is a memory cache of fixed-size disk blocks in the next lower layer.
- A system contains adjacent layers with similar abstractions is a red flag of class decomposition problem.
- The internal representations should be different from the abstractions that appear in the interface; if the interface and the implementation have similar abstractions, the class is shallow.
- It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation to benefit more user.
  - Simple implementation example: throw an exception when don't know how to handle the condition; define configuration parameters (developers should compute reasonable defaults automatically for configuration parameters).
  - Simple interface example: make a text editor GUI character-oriented rather on line-oriented so users can insert and delete arbitrary ranges of text.

** Pass-through methods
- A pass-through method is a method that does little except invoke another method, whose signature is similar or identical to the callee function.
- Pass-through methods usually indicates there is not a clean **division of responsibility** between classes.
- Pass-through methods also create dependencies between classes.
- The solution is to refactor the classes, e.g., expose the lower level class directly to the higher level (b), redistribute the functionality (c) or merge them (d):

** Pass-through variables
- A pass-through variable is a variable that is passed down through a long chain of methods.
- Pass-through variables add complexity as all intermediate methods must be aware of the existence and need to be modified when a new variable is used.
- The author's solution is to introduce a **context** object which stores all application's global states, e.g., configuration options and timeout value, and there is one context object per system instance.
- To avoid passing through the context variable, a reference to the context can be saved in other objects.
  - When a new object is created, the context reference is passed to the constructor.
- Contexts should be immutable to avoid thread-safety issues and may create non-obvious dependencies.

** Acceptable interface duplication
- Dispatcher: a method that uses its arguments to select a specific method to invoke and passes most of its arguments.
  - E.g., when a web server receives an HTTP request, it invokes a dispatcher to examine the URL and selects a specific method to handle the request.
- Polymorphous methods, e.g., ~len(string)~ and ~len(array)~ reduces cognitive load; they are usally in the same layer and do not invoke each other.
- Decorator: a wrapper that takes an existing object and extends its functionality.
- Decorators are often shallow and contain pass-through methods, one should consider following alternatives before using them:
  - Add the new functionality directly to the class if it is relatively general-purpose; or merge it with the specific use case if it is specialized.
  - Merge the new functionality with an existing decorator to make the existing decorator deeper.
  - Implement it as a stand-alone class independent of the base class, e.g., ~Window~ and ~ScrollableWindow~.

* Combine or separate functionality
- The goal is to reduce the system complexity as a **whole** and improve its modularity.
  - Subdividing components create additional complexity, e.g. additional code.
  - Developers should separate one general-purpose code from special-purpose code, each special-purpose code should go in a different module, e.g., pull the special-purpose code into higher layers.
    - A general-purpose mechanism provides **interfaces** for special-purpose code to override.
    - Each special-purpose code implements particular logic which is unaware by other code, including the general-purpose mechanism.
  - Combining codes is most beneficial if they are closely related:
    - They share information, e.g., HTTP request reader and parser.
    - They share repeated pattern, e.g., may ~goto~ same cleanup code.
    - The combination simplifies the interface, e.g., each code implement a part of the solution.
    - They are used together bi-directionally, e.g., a specific error message which is only invoked by one method.
    - They overlap conceptually in that there is single higher-level category including both code.
  - Each method should do one thing and do it **completely**.
    - The length itself is rarely a good reason for splitting up methods.
    - If a method is subdivided, users should be able to understand the child method independently, which typically means the child method is relatively general-purpose, otherwise conjoined methods are created.
