* What happened?

About three weeks ago, I hiked Stoos and wrote a Redbook post.
Unfortunately, the post was only visible to me, apparently violating community guidelines.

I spent most of that day trying to identify the problematic content, repeatedly editing and reposting.
Later, I learned this behavior is discouraged on Redbook, e.g., I am not really authorized to edit my own content.

Frustrated, I abandoned my efforts, leaving my Redbook homepage cluttered with articles like "10 Behaviors That Harm Your Redbook Account" and "100 Forbidden Words on Redbook".

Though brief, this experience instilled in me a tendency towards self-censorship, a feeling I deeply resent.
I also noticed the lack of competitive alternatives to this centralized platform where users share authentic life experiences through multimedia.

Well played, Redbook!

* What now?

Anyway, given that I invested considerable effort in creating post figures, I will post them here instead.
