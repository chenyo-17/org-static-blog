This is a personal note for [[https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/04/reth-perf][Reth-performance-blog]] as well as some terminology explain online, e.g., [[https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth][Reth-repo]] and [[https://claude.ai/chat/6364436f-d279-4c6b-947e-237bfea26409][Claude.ai]].

* Blockchain fundamentals

** [[https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/blob/a0d03086564ab1838b462befbc083f873dcf0c0f/src/engine/paris.md][Ethereum engine API]]
- A collection of JSON-RPC methods that all execution clients implement.
- Specify the interfaces between consensus and execution layers.

** [[https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/][Foundry]]
- A Rust-written toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- Consists of an Ethereum testing framework Forge; a framework to interact with the chain Cast; a local Ethereum node Anvil; and a Solidity REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop: an interactive environment) Chisel.

** [[https://github.com/bluealloy/revm/][Revm]]
- A Rust-written EVM; responsible for executing transactions and contracts.

** [[https://github.com/alloy-rs][Alloy]]
- A library to interact with the Ethereum and other EVM-base chains.

** [[https://erigon.tech/][Erigon]] & Staged sync
- Erigon: a Go-written Ethereum client implementation (execution layer).
- Staged sync: break the chain synchronization process into distinct stages in order to achieve better efficiency.

** Storage engines
*** ACID
- A set of properties for database transactions: atomicity, consistency, isolation, duration.
- Atomicity: a transaction is treated as an indivisible unit; if any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back.
- Consistency: a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.
- Isolation: concurrent transaction execution leave the database in the same state as if transactions are executed sequentially
- Duration: a committed transaction remains committed even when the system fails.

*** MVCC (Multi-version concurrency control)
- A concurrency control model used in DBMS.
- MVCC keeps multiple version of data simultaneously, each transaction sees a snapshot of the database.

*** Common database models
- Relational model, e.g., SQL.
- Document model.
- Network model.
- key-value, e.g., NoSQL.

*** Common storage engines
- MDBX: Ultra-fate key-value embedded database with ACID and MVCC supported.
- LevelDB: Google-developed key-value store using log-structured merge-tree for high write throughput.
- RocksDB: Meta's fork of LevelDB, optimized for fast storage.
- LSM-based DBs, e.g., BadgerDB: optimized for write-heavy workloads with log-structured merge-tree.
- BoltDB: Go-written key-value database with optimized B+ tree, ACID supported.
- LMDB: memory-mapped key-value store with ACID and MVCC supported.

** Reth
- A Rust implementation of an Ethereum full node; allows users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain.
- An execution layer that implements all Ethereum engine APIs.
- Modularity: every component is built as a library.
- Performance: uses Erigon staged-sync node architecture and other Rust libraries (e.g., Alloy, revm); tests and optimizes on Foundry.
- Database/Storage engine: MDBX.

** Why gas per second as the performance metric
- More nuanced than TPS.
- Allows for a clear understanding for the capacity and efficiency.
- Helps assessing the cost implications, e.g., DoS attacks.

** EVM cost models
- Determines the computational and storage costs for the execution.
- Key aspects: gas, gas cost (for each operation), gas price (in Wei), gas limit.

** TPC benchmark
- Standardized performance tests for transaction processing and databases, e.g., how many transactions a system can process in a given period.
- Offer benchmarks for different scenarios, e.g., TPC-C for online transaction processing.

** State growth
- State: the set of data for building and validating new Ethereum blocks.
- State growth: the accumulation of new account and new contract storage.

** JIT (Just-In-Time) and AOT (Ahead-of-Time) EVM
- JIT: convert bytecode to native machine code just before execution to bypass the VM's interpretative process.
- AOT: compile the highest demand contracts and store them on disk, to avoid untrusted bytecode absuing native-code compilation.

** Actor model
- A paradigm/framework for designing distributed systems.
- Actor: each actor is an independent entity to receive, process and send messages; create new actors or modify its state.

* Reth scaling plan
- Current status (April 2024): achieves 100-200 mg/s during live sync, including sender recovery, transaction execution and block trie calculation.
- The scaling plan does not involve solving state growth.

** Vertical scaling (2024)
- Optimize how each system handle transactions and data.

*** JIT/AOT EVM
- Reduce EVM interpreter overhead to speed up single-threaded transaction processing.
- The processing costs \(\approx\) 50% EVM time
- Released on [[https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/06/revmc][June 2024]].

*** Parallel EVM
- Utilize multiple cores during EVM execution.
- <80% of historical transactions have non-conflicting dependencies.
- Historical sync: can calculate the best parallelization schedule offine; an early attempt is [[https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/tree/rkrasiuk/parallel][available]].
- Live sync: combine serial and parallel execution based on static analysis, since Block STM has poor performance during heavy state contention periods; an early attempt is [[https://github.com/risechain/pevm][available]].

*** Optimized state commitment (?)
- In Reth, the state root is computed based on a KV database updated by transaction execution, thus the database is trie-agnostic.
- The state root computation costs >75% of end-to-end block production time.
- Fully parallelized state root: calculate the accounts trie in parallel while computing state root (how?).
- Pipelined state root: pre-fetch intermediate trie nodes from the disk.
# - Reduce the overhead of committing to the state in a verifiable way.
# - Should be compatible with fault proofs, ZK proofs, light clients.

** Horizontal scaling (2025)
- Spread the workload across multiple systems.

*** Multi-Rollup
- Reduce operational overhead of running multiple rollups.

*** Cloud-Native
