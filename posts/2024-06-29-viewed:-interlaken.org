* Why did we go
- According to the unpredictable [[https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/#tab=forecast-map][Meteoswiss]] forecast, this Saturday would have been the only weekend-day with some good weather in limited locations to go hiking since 2? or 3? weeks ago.
- But this was not the case anymore when we arrived the [[https://www.interlaken.ch/en/experiences/mountains-panoramas/mountain-excursions/brienzer-rothorn][Rothorn Kulm]] restaurant via the [[https://www.interlaken.ch/en/experiences/poi/brienz-rothorn-railway][steam train]].

* What did we do
1. We first went a tour in Aareschlucht, where we experienced both strong cold wind and gentle warm wind.
2. We then did a half-hour small hiking to go back to our starting point.
3. Then we drove to Brienz, and had a relaxing lunch along the lake, where I ate a piece of watermelon.
4. We took the 1-hour steam train to the Rothorn Kulm, when we arrived it started to be foggy, windy and rainy.
5. We refilled our energy with hot drinks and snacks in the restaurant, and took a short stroll around the restaurant.
6. We went back to the restaurant to escape the cold (yes it is end of June) and waited for the steam train to go down.
7. During the train down the sun came out a bit, and the view was clear and nice again!
