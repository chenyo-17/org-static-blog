This is a personal note for [[https://megaeth.systems/research][MegaETH-blog]] as well as some terminology explained online, e.g.,  [[https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/][ethereum.org]].

In summary, this blog proposes many challenges when designing a high-performance EVM chain, but does not include any design details of MegaETH itself.

* Blockchain fundamentals
** [[https://docs.conduit.xyz/][Conduit chain]]
- Allows one to deploy a rollup through its Rollups-as-a-service platform within in minutes.

** Gas per second
- Reflects the amount of computation the blockchain can handle per second.
- Different EVM operation costs different gas, e.g., ~ADD~ costs 3 gas.
- Block gas limit: ensures that any node can reliably keep up with the rest of the network.

** Target gas per block
- Dynamically regulate the amount of computation a block can include.
- ~Gas per second = Target Gas per block / Block time~.

** Current blockchain scalability

- Throughput: 100MGas/s (\(\approx\) 3700 ERC-20 transfer) cannot compares to Web2 database with >1M transactions per second.
- Capacity: Complex applications cannot be on-chain, e.g., compute large Fibonacci (e.g., \(10^8\)) number would take 55 seconds on opBNB, while in C just 30 milliseconds in a single core.
- Delay: Applications that require fast feedback loop, e.g., high-frequency trading are not feasible with long block times, e.g., 1s.

** Blockchain node hardware requirements
- Lower hardware requirements for full nodes increase decentralization.
- Higher requirements increase performance and security.

** L1 and L2 nodes
- L1 nodes are homogeneous; each node performs identical tasks, i.e., transaction consensus and execution without specialization.
- L2 nodes are heterogeneous; different nodes perform specific tasks, e.g., sequencer node determines the transaction order, prover nodes rely on accelerators to enhance proof generation.

** Verifying a block
- Re-execute the transactions in the block.
- Applying the changes to Ethereum state trie.
- Calculate the new root hash and compare it with the root hash provided by the block.

** Maximum extractable value (MEV)
- Validators maximize their profitability by favorably ordering transactions.

** Proposer-builder separation (PBS)
- Block builders are responsible for creating blocks and offering them to the block proposer in each slot.
- Block proposers cannot see the contents, but simply choose the most profitable one and pay a fee to the block builder before broadcasting the block.
- PBS makes it harder for block builders to censor transactions, and to outperform individuals at MEV extraction.

** Live and historical sync
- Live (online): continuously update a node with the latest data.
- Historical (offline): synchronize a node by downloading the processing data up to a certain point.
- Historical sync has much higher TPS than live sync, e.g., 10x, since historical sync can perform batch processing and does not have network latency.

** [[https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/portal-network/][Portal Network]]
- An in-development p2p network for serving historical data where each node stores a small piece of Ethereum's history.
- Light nodes do not need to trust on full nodes.
- The entire history exists distributed across the network.

** [[https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/verkle-trees/][Verkle tree]]
- Stateless clients use a witness to the state data that arrives with the block instead of local databases.
- **Witness**: the minimal set of data that prove the values of the state that are being changed by the transactions in a block.
# - Witness: A collection of individual pieces of the state data required to execute the block transactions, and a cryptographic proof that the witness is indeed a part of the full data.
- Merkle tree is too large to be broadcast between peers; the witness is a path connecting the data from leaved to the root, and to verify the data the hash of all sibling nodes are also required (to compute the parent hash).
- Verkle trees reduce the witness size by shortening the distance between leaves and eliminating the need to provide sibling nodes; Using a polynomial commitment scheme(?) allows the witness to have a fixed size.

** Node storage
- High disk space is the main barrier to a full node access, due to the need to store large chunks of Ethereum state data to process new transactions.
- Using cheap hard drivers to store old data cannot keep up with new blocks.
- Clients should find new ways to verify transactions without relying on looking up local databases.

*** History expiry
- Nodes discard state data older than X blocks with weak subjectivity checkpoints, i.e., a genesis block close to the present.
- Nodes can request historical data from peers with Portal Network, e.g., altruistic nodes that are willing to maintain and serve historical achieves, e.g., DAO.
- Does not fundamentally change how Ethereum node handles data.
- Controversial due to it could introduce new censorship risks if centralized organizations are providing historical data.
- EIP-4444 is under active discussion regarding community management.

*** State expiry
- Remove state from individual nodes if it has not been accessed recently.
- The inactive accounts is not deleted, but stored separately from the active state and can be resurrected.
- A leading approach requires to add timestamps to the account address.
- The responsibility of storing old data may also be moved to centralized providers.

*** Statelessness
- weak statelessness: only block producers need access to full state data.
- Weak statelessness require Verkle trees and proposer-builder separation.
- strong statelessness: no nodes need access to the full state data.
- In strong statelessness, witnesses are generated by users to declare accounts related to the transaction; not a part of Ethereum's roadmap.

** Software transactional memory (STM)
- A concurrency control mechanism to control access to shares memory in software.
- A transaction refers to a piece of ode executing a series of reads and writes to the shared memory.
- Transactions are isolated; changes made by one transaction are not visible to others until the transaction commits.
- When a conflict is detected, e.g., two transactions try to modify the same memory, one transaction is rolled back.

** Block-STM
- A parallel execution engine to schedule smart contract transactions based on STM.
- Transactions are grouped in blocks, every execution of the block must yield the deterministic and consistent outcome.

* What is MagaETH

- An EVM-compatible L2 blockchain with Web2-level real-time processing and publishing, i.e., millisecond-level response times under heavy load.
- Main idea: delegate security and censorship resistance to base layers, e.g., Ethereum to make room for L2 optimization.

** Node specialization
 - sequencer: only one active sequencer at any time to **eliminate the consensus overhead**.
 - full node: receive state diff from the sequencer via a p2p network and apply the diffs to update local states; don't re-execute transactions, only validates the block indirectly using proofs provided by the provers.
 - provers: validate the block asynchronously using the stateless validation scheme.
 - [[https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html][Endgame, Vitalik 2021]]: Node specialization ensures trustless and high decentralized block validation (more provers), even though block production becomes more centralized (one sequencer).
  
** Design philosophy
- Reth (Rust implementation of the Ethereum protocol) is bottlenecked by the MPT update in a live sync setup, even with a powerful sequencer.
- [[https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc19/presentation/keynote][Measure, then build]]: first get insights from real problems, then design techniques to address all problems simultaneously.
- Prefer clean-slate, as addressing any bottleneck in isolation rarely results in significant end-to-end performance improvement.

- State synchronization requires high data compression given limited network bandwidth.
- Updating the hash root requires intensive disk I/O operation, which cannot be well speedup with optimized smart-contract compilers.
- Cannot easily raise block gas limit without properly repricing opcodes that do not benefit from optimized compilation.
- Parallelism is low for long dependency chains.
- The actual user experience highly depend on the infrastructure, e.g., RPC nodes, indexers.
- Support transaction priorities, e.g., critical transactions should be processed without queuing delays.
 # - interpreter overhead: optimized compiler speedup are limited in a production environment where smart-contracts are mostly not compute-intensive (e.g., I/O read/write).
# ** Produce blocks consistently at high frequency
