* Blockchain fundamentals
** RLP (Recursive Length Prefix)
- A serialization method to encode arbitrarily nested arrays of binary data.
- RLP provides a simple (e.g., no type), space-efficient and deterministic encoding.

** Merkle tree
- Used in Bitcoin to simplify proof of inclusion (PoI) of a transaction.
- If one computes the hash of an array of \(N\):
  - Construction complexity: \(O(n)\) time and space.
  - PoI complexity: \(O(n)\) time and space (needs all other items).

*** Complexity for \(N\) items.
- Construction: \(O(2n)\) time and space.
- PoI complexity:
  - \(O(logN)\) space: PoI requires one hash from each level from the leaf to the root (the Merkle tree is binary).
  - \(O(logN)\) time: \(O(logN)\) to collect all hashes, and \(O(logN)\) to generate the proof.

** Patricia tree
- Trie: a data structure that stores key-value pair in a key's prefix tree.
- Patricia tree: compress trie by merging nodes on the same path.
- The structure the Patricia tree is independent of the item insertion order.
- The time complexity for add, query and deletion is \(O(K)\), where \(K\) is the key length.

** Merkle Patricia Tree (MPT)
- MPT is a hex-ary Merkle tree with an additional DB for hash lookup.
- There are 4 types of nodes:
  - Empty node: the null node the root points to when first creating the tree.
  - Leaf node: stores the real data, e.g., account balance.
  - Branch node: stores the pointers to at most 16 other nodes, e.g., they have the common prefix (nibbles) before and differ at the current **nibble** (4 bit,0-f).
  - Extension node: record the compressed common prefix for a branch node.
- Each **pointer** in the tree is the **hash value** of the child node; the real node data is stored in a separate DB that maps from a node hash to its data.
-  If the child node is small, the parent node could also directly store the node data rather than the hash pointer.
- In practical implementation, the **entire tree** is typically stored in a KV DB, and each node is stored with its hash as the key.

*** Prefix byte
- Identify both the node type and the parity of the stored nibbles.
- Leaf node: 2 if the ~key-end~ has even number of nibbles, e.g., the compressed ending of an account; 3X if the number is odd (so the last 4-bit is stored as X in the prefix).
- Extension: 0 if the ~shared nibbles~ has even number; 1X if has odd number.

*** Complexity for \(N\) items and key length \(K\)
- Construction:
  - Time: worst \(O(NK)\); average: \(O(log_{16}N)\).
  - Space: \(O(N)\).
- Indexing (e.g., query an account balance):
  - Time: tree traversal worst \(O(K)\), average \(O(log_{16}N)\); **each traversal equals a DB query**.
- PoI: \(O(log_{16}N)\) time and space.

* Ethereum MPT data structure
- Essentially is a key-value mapping; it provides ~Get~, ~Put~ and ~Del~ functions.
- Ethereum has 3 MPTs: transaction trie; receipt trie and state trie, each trie root hash is included in the block header.
  - ~transactionTrie~: all transactions included in the block.
    - The keys are the RLP encodings of an unsigned integer starting from 0.
    - The values are the RLP encodings of the transaction.
  - ~stateTrie~: all account states in the network.
  - ~receiptTrie~: the outcomes of all transaction executions in the block, e.g., gas used, transaction status.

* Ethereum MPT Functionality
- Allows to verify **data integrity** with the ~Hash~ function to compute the Merkle root hash.
- Allows to verify the **inclusion** of a key-value pair without the access to the entire key-value pairs.
  - A full node provide a merkle proof ~Proof~ for a key-value pair (e.g., an account and its balance).
  - A light node can verify a proof only against the root hash with ~VerifyProf(rootHash, key, proof)~; if the proof does not match the hash (e.g., the balance mismatches), an error is thrown.
- Why would a light node trust the root hash: it trusts the consensus mechanism, e.g., other benign full nodes verify the hash, act honestly is more profitable.

* Proof of inclusion
- Proof: the path from the root to the leaf node.
- Verification: start from the root, decode the node to match the nibbles until find the node that matches all the remaining nibbles; if not found, the proof is invalid.
