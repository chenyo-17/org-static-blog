      </h1>
      <p>
        It&rsquo;s been a while since I wanted to document my experience in my
        German course. Now, having completed the first month, there
        couldn&rsquo;t be a better time to do so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initially, I approached the course with some dissatisfaction. The pace
        felt too slow, and I was critical of my teacher&rsquo;s methods. Boredom
        and impatience set in as I waited for others to catch up.
      </p>

      <p>
        But then I began interacting with my classmates, and I had the chance to
        hear a different world.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first people I met was a talkative Ukrainian woman. When she
        is not satisfied with something, she interrupts and shouts. She knows a
        lot about healthcare, and she told me this and that about refugee
        polices. I admire her enviable energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I first walked in the classroom, I noticed a young man who already
        spoke rapid German. I asked him how he did it and he said since he
        started learning German four months ago, he only spoke German. He is
        smart and also speaks English, Turkish and Afghanistan. His experience
        reminds me a lot of the book &ldquo;The New Odyssey&rdquo;, and I am
        curious about more of his stories. He is only 19 years old, I believe a
        bright future awaits him.

        The man sitting next to me has a political asylum visa. He was a
        political journalist not welcomed by the government. He said so he lived
        at the borderline for many years before he came here. He is no longer
        young and it was his second time to take the same course. He has a
        beautiful handwriting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another young man I know a bit comes from Latin America, he often dozes
        off in the class due to his Uber delivery job. I also met a young lady
        from Turkey, she is so charming with a wonderful personality. There are
        also two resilient mothers who undertake childcare with their studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last week I finally got to know my teacher a bit. He told us he
        worked 220 hours a month at the moment so that he can pay his expense
        for he and his girlfriend, and he used to work even more. He said he had
        different trainings in different countries, and now he finally got a new
        passport. He shared with us different information that help foreigners
        maintain a basic life here.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, I still think the course is too easy for me, who has spent
        twenty years staying in schools. But I wish I had talked more with
        everyone about their lives. So many people come here, and each finds
        their own way to stay and live. Life is always hard but also incredible,
        and I wish I don&rsquo;t ever forget it.
