<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
This week, I found myself craving a movie with a &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo; theme.
Then the name of Argo came to me.
I saw its name a decade ago (I am too old!) on some movie magazine cover.

<h2 id="org7c27470"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> What is it about</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
It has little thing to do with &ldquo;Homeland&rdquo;.
Instead, it blends action, comedy and drama based on a true story, although non of any dramatic conflicts really happened in history afak.
It is about how a selfless agent, backed by an entire intelligence system which behaved incredibly efficient, and an alliance which also behaved incredibly generous, escaped a group of compatriots, who also behaved incredibly brave, from a dangerous place.
My boyfriend said it is quite &ldquo;Hitchcock&rdquo;.
Every tension resolves safely in the end: the phone will be picked up at the last second, the plane will take off at the last second, even the plane tickets will magically show up at the last second (Swissair yeah!).

I guess?
The filming is good, as well as the narration and the performance.
There were some moments where I was not fully convinced, but I accept them if that was the history.
What really amazed me was when I found the actor of Tony was also the director, and also wrote &ldquo;Good Will Hunting (1997)&rdquo;, what a genius!
But I guessed I preferred &ldquo;Civil war (2024)&rdquo; (my last movie) to this one.
The reason?
I felt &ldquo;Argo&rdquo; could have delved deeper into the absurdities of war rather than solely focusing on a heroic narrative.
