<h2 id="org5f07db3"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most fundamental problem in CS is <b><b>problem decomposition</b></b>: how to divide a complex problem into pieces that can be solved independently.</li>
<li>Complexity increases <b><b>inevitably</b></b> over the life of the program, but simpler designs allow to build larger systems before complexity becomes overwhelming.</li>
<li>Two general approaches:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making code more obvious, e.g., eliminating special cases, using identifiers in a consistent fashion.</li>
<li>Encapsulate the complexity, i.e., divide a system into independent modules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Waterfall model: each phase of a project e.g., requirement, design, coding, testing, completes before the next phase starts, such that the entire system is designed once.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does not work for software since the problem of the initial design do not become apparent until implementation is well underway; then the developers need to patch around the problems, resulting in an explosion of complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Agile/Incremental development: in each iteration the design focuses on a small subset of the overall functionality, so that problems can be fixed when the system is small and later features benefit from previous experience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Developers should always think about design issues and complexity, and use complexity to guide the design.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orga0995c7" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orga0995c7"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Complexity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is <b><b>incremental</b></b>.</li>
<li>Developers must adopt a <b><b>zero tolerance</b></b> philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgafabfcc" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgafabfcc"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Definition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.</li>
<li>\(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\): The overall complexity  is determined by the complexity of each part \(p\) weighted by the fraction of time developers working on that part.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is as good as eliminating the complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers: if you write a piece of code that seems simple to you, but others think it is complex, then it is complex.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orge696c8e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orge696c8e"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Symptoms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change amplification: a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places.</li>
<li>Cognitive load: developers have to spend more time learning the required information to complete a task, which leads to greater risk of bugs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., a function allocates memory and returns a pointer to the memory, but assumes the caller should free the memory.</li>
<li>Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler as it reduces cognitive load.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unknown unknowns (the worst!): it is not obvious which pieces of code must be modified or which information must have to complete the task.</li>
<li>The goal of a good design is for a system to be <b><b>obvious</b></b>: a developer can make a quick guess about what to do and yet to be confident that the guess is correct.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf7fb069" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf7fb069"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Causes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is caused by two things: <b><b>dependencies</b></b> and <b><b>obscurity</b></b>.</li>
<li>A dependency exists when a code cannot be understood and modified in isolation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., in network protocols both senders and receivers must conform to the protocol, changing code for the sender almost always requires corresponding changes at the receiver.</li>
<li>Dependencies are fundamental and cannot be completely eliminated, the goal is to make the dependencies remain simple and obvious (e.g., variable renaming are detected by compilers).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obscurity occurs when important information is not obvious, e.g., a variable is too generic or the documentation is inadequate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obscurity is often associated with non-obvious dependencies.</li>
<li>Inconsistency is also a major contributor, e.g., the same variable name is used for two different purposes.</li>
<li>The need for extensive documentation is often a red flag that the design is complex.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dependencies lead to change amplification and cognitive load; obscurity creates unknown unknowns and cognitive load.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1d71922" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1d71922"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Programming mindsets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tactical programming: the main focus is to get something working, e.g., a new feature or a bug fix.</li>
<li>Tactical programming is short-sighted, e.g., each task contributes a reasonable compromise to finish the current task quickly.</li>
<li>Once a code base turns to spaghetti, it is nearly impossible to fix.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf1e769f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf1e769f"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Strategic programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Requires an investment mindset to improve the system design rather than taking the fastest path to finish the current task.</li>
<li>Proactive investment: try a couple of alternative designs and pick the cleanest one; imagine a few ways in which the system might need to be changed in the future; write documentation.</li>
<li>Reactive investments: continuously make small improvements to the system design when a design problem becomes obvious rather than patching around it.</li>
<li>The ideal design tends to emerge in bits and pieces, thus the best approach is to make lots of <b><b>small</b></b> investments on a <b><b>continual</b></b> basis, e.g., 10-20% of total development time on investments.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org447a65a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org447a65a"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Modular design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The goal of modular design is to minimize the dependencies between modules.</li>
<li>Each module consists of two parts: interface and implementation. The interface describes what the module does, the implementation specifies how it does.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The interface consists of everything that a developer working on a different module must know in order to use the given module.</li>
<li>The implementation consists of the code that carries out the promises made by the interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The best modules are <b><b>deep</b></b>, i.e., those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In such cases the modification in the implementation is less likely to affect other modules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Small modules tend to be shallow, because the benefit they provide is negated by the cost of learning and using their interfaces.</li>
<li>Classitis refers to a mistaken view that developers should minimize the amount of functionality in each new class.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It may result in classes that are individually simple, but increases the overall complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8eb4bb6" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8eb4bb6"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Interface</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A module interface contains two information: formal and informal.</li>
<li>The formal part for a method is its signature; The formal interface for a class consists of the signatures for all public methods and variables.</li>
<li>The informal part includes its high-level behavior and usage constraints; they can only be described using comments and cannot be ensured by the programming languages.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Informal aspects are larger and more complex than the formal aspects for most interfaces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While providing choice is good, interfaces should be designed to make the <b><b>common case</b></b> as simple as possible (c.f. \(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\)).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf32c40f" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf32c40f"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which omits unimportant details.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more unimportant details that are omitted from an abstraction, the better, otherwise the abstraction increases the cognitive load.</li>
<li>A detail can only be omitted if it is unimportant, otherwise obscurity occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In modular programming, each module provides an abstraction in form of its interface.</li>
<li>The key to designing abstractions is to understand what is important.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., how to choose storage blocks for a file is unimportant to users, but the rules for flushing data to secondary storage is important for databases, hence it must be visible in the file system interface.</li>
<li>Garbage collectors in Go and Java do not have interface at all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc9d1398" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc9d1398"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Information hiding</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Information hiding is the most important technique for achieving deep modules.</li>
<li>Each module should encapsulate a few design information (e.g., data structures, low-level details) in the module implementation but not appear in its interface.</li>
<li>Information hiding simplifies the module interface and makes it easier to evolve the system as a design change related a hidden information only affects that module.</li>
<li>Making an item <code>private</code> is not the same as information hiding, as the information about the private items can still be exposed through public methods such as <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code>.</li>
<li>If a particular information is only needed by a few of a class&rsquo;s users, it can be <b><b>partially</b></b> hidden if it is accessed through separate methods, so that it is still invisible in the most common use cases.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., modules should provide adequate <b><b>defaults</b></b> and only callers that want to override the default need to be aware of the parameter.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org53cd874" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org53cd874"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Information leakage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The leakage occurs when a design decision is reflected in multiple modules. thus creating dependencies between the modules.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interface information is by definition has been leaked.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information can be leaked even if it does not appear in the interface, i.e., back-door leakage.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., two classes read and write the same file format, then if the format changes, both classes need to be modified; such leakage is more pernicious than interface leakage as it is not obvious.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If affected classes are relatively small and closely tied to the leaked information, they may need to be <b><b>merged</b></b> into a single class.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The bigger class is deeper as the entire computation is easier to be abstracted in the interface compared to separate sub-computations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One may also pull the leaked information out of all affected classes and create a new class to encapsulate the information, i.e., replace back-door leakage with interface leakage.</li>
<li>One should avoid exposing internal data structures (e.g., return by reference) as such approach makes more work for callers, and make the module shallow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., instead of writing <code>getParams()</code> which returns a map of all parameters, one should have <code>getParameter(String name)</code> and <code>getIntParameter(String name)</code> to return a specific parameter and throw an exception if the name does not exist or cannot be converted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org235508e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org235508e"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Temporal decomposition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Temporal decomposition is a common cause of information leakage.</li>
<li>It decompose the system into operations corresponding to the execution order.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., A file-reading application is broken into 3 classes: read, modify and write, then both reading and writing steps have knowledge about the file format.</li>
<li>The solution is to combine the core mechanisms for reading and writing into a single class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Orders should not be reflected in the module structure unless different stages use totally different information.</li>
<li>One should focus on the <b><b>knowledge</b></b> needed to perform each task, not the order in which tasks occur.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgca1cba1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgca1cba1"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> General-Purpose modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>General-purpose modules can be used to address a broad range of problems such that it may find unanticipated uses in the future (cf. investment mindset).</li>
<li>Special-purpose modules are specialized for today&rsquo;s needs, and can be refactored to make it general-purpose when additional uses are required (cf. incremental software development).</li>
<li>The author recommends a &ldquo;somewhat general-purpose&rdquo; fashion: the functionality should reflect the current needs, but the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses.</li>
<li>The following questions can be asked to find the balance between general-purpose and special-purpose approach:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is the simplest interface that will cover all current needs?</li>
<li>How many situations will a method be used?</li>
<li>Is the API easy to use for the current needs (not go too far)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7c2b244" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org7c2b244"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Example: GUI text editor design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Specialized design: use individual method in the text class to support each high-level features, e.g., <code>backspace(Cursor cursor)</code> deletes the character before the cursor; <code>delete(Cursor cursor)</code> deletes the character after the cursor; <code>deleteSelection(Selection selection)</code> deletes the selected section.</li>
<li>The specialized design creates a high cognitive load for the UI developers: the implementation ends up with a large number of shallow methods so a UI developer had to learn all of them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., <code>backspace</code> provides a false abstraction as it does not hide the information about which character to delete.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The specialized design also creates information leakage: abstractions related to the UI such as backspace key and selection, are reflected in the text class, increasing the cognitive load for the text class developers.</li>
<li>General-purpose design define API only in terms of <b><b>basic</b></b> text features without reflecting the higher-level operations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only three methods are needed to modify a text: <code>insert(Position position, String newText)</code>,  <code>delete(Position start, Position end)</code> and <code>changePosition(Position position, int numChars)</code>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The new API uses a more generic <code>Position</code> to replace a specific user interface <code>Cursor</code>.</li>
<li>The delete key can be implemented as <code>text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, 1))</code>, the backspace key can be implemented as <code>text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, -1))</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The new design is more obvious, e.g., the UI developer knows which character to delete from the interface, and also has less code overall.</li>
<li>The general-purpose methods can also be used for new feature, e.g., search and replace text.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6562446" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6562446"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Layers of abstractions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software systems are composed into layers, where higher layers use the facilities provided by lower layers; each layer provides an abstraction different from the layers above or below it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., a file in the uppermost layer is an array of bytes and is a memory cache of fixed-size disk blocks in the next lower layer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A system contains adjacent layers with similar abstractions is a red flag of class decomposition problem.</li>
<li>The internal representations should be different from the abstractions that appear in the interface; if the interface and the implementation have similar abstractions, the class is shallow.</li>
<li>It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation to benefit more user.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Simple implementation example: throw an exception when don&rsquo;t know how to handle the condition; define configuration parameters (developers should compute reasonable defaults automatically for configuration parameters).</li>
<li>Simple interface example: make a text editor GUI character-oriented rather on line-oriented so users can insert and delete arbitrary ranges of text.</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="org152a295"><span class="section-number-3">7.1.</span> Pass-through methods</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pass-through method is a method that does little except invoke another method, whose signature is similar or identical to the callee function.</li>
<li>Pass-through methods usually indicates there is not a clean <b><b>division of responsibility</b></b> between classes.</li>
<li>Pass-through methods also create dependencies between classes.</li>
<li>The solution is to refactor the classes, e.g., expose the lower level class directly to the higher level (b), redistribute the functionality (c) or merge them (d):</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pass-through variable is a variable that is passed down through a long chain of methods.</li>
<li>Pass-through variables add complexity as all intermediate methods must be aware of the existence and need to be modified when a new variable is used.</li>
<li>The author&rsquo;s solution is to introduce a <b><b>context</b></b> object which stores all application&rsquo;s global states, e.g., configuration options and timeout value, and there is one context object per system instance.</li>
<li>To avoid passing through the context variable, a reference to the context can be saved in other objects.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a new object is created, the context reference is passed to the constructor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Contexts should be immutable to avoid thread-safety issues and may create non-obvious dependencies.</li>

<li>Dispatcher: a method that uses its arguments to select a specific method to invoke and passes most of its arguments.

</ul></li>
<li>Polymorphous methods, e.g., <code>len(string)</code> and <code>len(array)</code> reduces cognitive load; they are usally in the same layer and do not invoke each other.</li>
<li>Decorator: a wrapper that takes an existing object and extends its functionality.</li>
<li>Decorators are often shallow and contain pass-through methods, one should consider following alternatives before using them:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add the new functionality directly to the class if it is relatively general-purpose; or merge it with the specific use case if it is specialized.</li>

<li>Developers should separate one general-purpose code from special-purpose code, each special-purpose code should go in a different module, e.g., pull the special-purpose code into higher layers.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A general-purpose mechanism provides <b><b>interfaces</b></b> for special-purpose code to override.</li>
<li>Each special-purpose code implements particular logic which is unaware by other code, including the general-purpose mechanism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Combining codes is most beneficial if they are closely related:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They share information, e.g., HTTP request reader and parser.</li>
<li>They share repeated pattern, e.g., may <code>goto</code> same cleanup code.</li>
<li>The combination simplifies the interface, e.g., each code implement a part of the solution.</li>
<li>They are used together bi-directionally, e.g., a specific error message which is only invoked by one method.</li>
<li>They overlap conceptually in that there is single higher-level category including both code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each method should do one thing and do it <b><b>completely</b></b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The length itself is rarely a good reason for splitting up methods.</li>
<li>If a method is subdivided, users should be able to understand the child method independently, which typically means the child method is relatively general-purpose, otherwise conjoined methods are created.</li>
</ul></li>
