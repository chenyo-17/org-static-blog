<h2 id="org6baa55b"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The most fundamental problem in CS is <b><b>problem decomposition</b></b>: how to divide a complex problem into pieces that can be solved independently.</li>
<li>Complexity increases <b><b>inevitably</b></b> over the life of the program, but simpler designs allow to build larger systems before complexity becomes overwhelming.</li>
<li>Two general approaches:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Making code more obvious, e.g., eliminating special cases, using identifiers in a consistent fashion.</li>
<li>Encapsulate the complexity, i.e., divide a system into independent modules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Waterfall model: each phase of a project e.g., requirement, design, coding, testing, completes before the next phase starts, such that the entire system is designed once.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Does not work for software since the problem of the initial design do not become apparent until implementation is well underway; then the developers need to patch around the problems, resulting in an explosion of complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Agile/Incremental development: in each iteration the design focuses on a small subset of the overall functionality, so that problems can be fixed when the system is small and later features benefit from previous experience.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Developers should always think about design issues and complexity, and use complexity to guide the design.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org89ddffb"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Complexity</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is <b><b>incremental</b></b>.</li>
<li>Developers must adopt a <b><b>zero tolerance</b></b> philosophy.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org92af109" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org92af109"><span class="section-number-3">2.1.</span> Definition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is anything related to the structure of a software system that makes it hard to understand and modify the system.</li>
<li>\(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\): The overall complexity  is determined by the complexity of each part \(p\) weighted by the fraction of time developers working on that part.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Isolating complexity in a place where it will never be seen is as good as eliminating the complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complexity is more apparent to readers than writers: if you write a piece of code that seems simple to you, but others think it is complex, then it is complex.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org00414ce" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org00414ce"><span class="section-number-3">2.2.</span> Symptoms</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Change amplification: a seemingly simple change requires code modifications in many different places.</li>
<li>Cognitive load: developers have to spend more time learning the required information to complete a task, which leads to greater risk of bugs.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., a function allocates memory and returns a pointer to the memory, but assumes the caller should free the memory.</li>
<li>Sometimes an approach that requires more lines of code is actually simpler as it reduces cognitive load.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Unknown unknowns (the worst!): it is not obvious which pieces of code must be modified or which information must have to complete the task.</li>
<li>The goal of a good design is for a system to be <b><b>obvious</b></b>: a developer can make a quick guess about what to do and yet to be confident that the guess is correct.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org04b48af" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org04b48af"><span class="section-number-3">2.3.</span> Causes</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Complexity is caused by two things: <b><b>dependencies</b></b> and <b><b>obscurity</b></b>.</li>
<li>A dependency exists when a code cannot be understood and modified in isolation.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., in network protocols both senders and receivers must conform to the protocol, changing code for the sender almost always requires corresponding changes at the receiver.</li>
<li>Dependencies are fundamental and cannot be completely eliminated, the goal is to make the dependencies remain simple and obvious (e.g., variable renaming are detected by compilers).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obscurity occurs when important information is not obvious, e.g., a variable is too generic or the documentation is inadequate.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Obscurity is often associated with non-obvious dependencies.</li>
<li>Inconsistency is also a major contributor, e.g., the same variable name is used for two different purposes.</li>
<li>The need for extensive documentation is often a red flag that the design is complex.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dependencies lead to change amplification and cognitive load; obscurity creates unknown unknowns and cognitive load.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org175a55a" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org175a55a"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Programming mindsets</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Tactical programming: the main focus is to get something working, e.g., a new feature or a bug fix.</li>
<li>Tactical programming is short-sighted, e.g., each task contributes a reasonable compromise to finish the current task quickly.</li>
<li>Once a code base turns to spaghetti, it is nearly impossible to fix.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5e3a4f3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org5e3a4f3"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Strategic programming</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Requires an investment mindset to improve the system design rather than taking the fastest path to finish the current task.</li>
<li>Proactive investment: try a couple of alternative designs and pick the cleanest one; imagine a few ways in which the system might need to be changed in the future; write documentation.</li>
<li>Reactive investments: continuously make small improvements to the system design when a design problem becomes obvious rather than patching around it.</li>
<li>The ideal design tends to emerge in bits and pieces, thus the best approach is to make lots of <b><b>small</b></b> investments on a <b><b>continual</b></b> basis, e.g., 10-20% of total development time on investments.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgd53f55d" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgd53f55d"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Modular design</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The goal of modular design is to minimize the dependencies between modules.</li>
<li>Each module consists of two parts: interface and implementation. The interface describes what the module does, the implementation specifies how it does.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The interface consists of everything that a developer working on a different module must know in order to use the given module.</li>
<li>The implementation consists of the code that carries out the promises made by the interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The best modules are <b><b>deep</b></b>, i.e., those whose interfaces are much simpler than their implementations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In such cases the modification in the implementation is less likely to affect other modules.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Small modules tend to be shallow, because the benefit they provide is negated by the cost of learning and using their interfaces.</li>
<li>Classitis refers to a mistaken view that developers should minimize the amount of functionality in each new class.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It may result in classes that are individually simple, but increases the overall complexity.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orged162f9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orged162f9"><span class="section-number-3">4.1.</span> Interface</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A module interface contains two information: formal and informal.</li>
<li>The formal part for a method is its signature; The formal interface for a class consists of the signatures for all public methods and variables.</li>
<li>The informal part includes its high-level behavior and usage constraints; they can only be described using comments and cannot be ensured by the programming languages.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Informal aspects are larger and more complex than the formal aspects for most interfaces.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>While providing choice is good, interfaces should be designed to make the <b><b>common case</b></b> as simple as possible (c.f. \(C = \sum_p(c_pt_p)\)).</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgbe57e9b" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgbe57e9b"><span class="section-number-3">4.2.</span> Abstraction</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which omits unimportant details.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The more unimportant details that are omitted from an abstraction, the better, otherwise the abstraction increases the cognitive load.</li>
<li>A detail can only be omitted if it is unimportant, otherwise obscurity occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In modular programming, each module provides an abstraction in form of its interface.</li>
<li>The key to designing abstractions is to understand what is important.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., how to choose storage blocks for a file is unimportant to users, but the rules for flushing data to secondary storage is important for databases, hence it must be visible in the file system interface.</li>
<li>Garbage collectors in Go and Java do not have interface at all.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org6fcd689" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org6fcd689"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Information hiding</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Information hiding is the most important technique for achieving deep modules.</li>
<li>Each module should encapsulate a few design information (e.g., data structures, low-level details) in the module implementation but not appear in its interface.</li>
<li>Information hiding simplifies the module interface and makes it easier to evolve the system as a design change related a hidden information only affects that module.</li>
<li>Making an item <code>private</code> is not the same as information hiding, as the information about the private items can still be exposed through public methods such as <code>getter</code> and <code>setter</code>.</li>
<li>If a particular information is only needed by a few of a class&rsquo;s users, it can be <b><b>partially</b></b> hidden if it is accessed through separate methods, so that it is still invisible in the most common use cases.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., modules should provide adequate <b><b>defaults</b></b> and only callers that want to override the default need to be aware of the parameter.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8195503" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8195503"><span class="section-number-3">5.1.</span> Information leakage</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The leakage occurs when a design decision is reflected in multiple modules. thus creating dependencies between the modules.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Interface information is by definition has been leaked.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Information can be leaked even if it does not appear in the interface, i.e., back-door leakage.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., two classes read and write the same file format, then if the format changes, both classes need to be modified; such leakage is more pernicious than interface leakage as it is not obvious.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If affected classes are relatively small and closely tied to the leaked information, they may need to be <b><b>merged</b></b> into a single class.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The bigger class is deeper as the entire computation is easier to be abstracted in the interface compared to separate sub-computations.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>One may also pull the leaked information out of all affected classes and create a new class to encapsulate the information, i.e., replace back-door leakage with interface leakage.</li>
<li>One should avoid exposing internal data structures (e.g., return by reference) as such approach makes more work for callers, and make the module shallow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., instead of writing <code>getParams()</code> which returns a map of all parameters, one should have <code>getParameter(String name)</code> and <code>getIntParameter(String name)</code> to return a specific parameter and throw an exception if the name does not exist or cannot be converted.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-org4b7fe34" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org4b7fe34"><span class="section-number-3">5.2.</span> Temporal decomposition</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Temporal decomposition is a common cause of information leakage.</li>
<li>It decompose the system into operations corresponding to the execution order.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., A file-reading application is broken into 3 classes: read, modify and write, then both reading and writing steps have knowledge about the file format.</li>
<li>The solution is to combine the core mechanisms for reading and writing into a single class.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Orders should not be reflected in the module structure unless different stages use totally different information.</li>
<li>One should focus on the <b><b>knowledge</b></b> needed to perform each task, not the order in which tasks occur.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org3edbff4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org3edbff4"><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> General-Purpose modules</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>General-purpose modules can be used to address a broad range of problems such that it may find unanticipated uses in the future (cf. investment mindset).</li>
<li>Special-purpose modules are specialized for today&rsquo;s needs, and can be refactored to make it general-purpose when additional uses are required (cf. incremental software development).</li>
<li>The author recommends a &ldquo;somewhat general-purpose&rdquo; fashion: the functionality should reflect the current needs, but the interface should be general enough to support multiple uses.</li>
<li>The following questions can be asked to find the balance between general-purpose and special-purpose approach:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What is the simplest interface that will cover all current needs?</li>
<li>How many situations will a method be used?</li>
<li>Is the API easy to use for the current needs (not go too far)?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgcf17332" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcf17332"><span class="section-number-3">6.1.</span> Example: GUI text editor design</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-6-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Specialized design: use individual method in the text class to support each high-level features, e.g., <code>backspace(Cursor cursor)</code> deletes the character before the cursor; <code>delete(Cursor cursor)</code> deletes the character after the cursor; <code>deleteSelection(Selection selection)</code> deletes the selected section.</li>
<li>The specialized design creates a high cognitive load for the UI developers: the implementation ends up with a large number of shallow methods so a UI developer had to learn all of them.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., <code>backspace</code> provides a false abstraction as it does not hide the information about which character to delete.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The specialized design also creates information leakage: abstractions related to the UI such as backspace key and selection, are reflected in the text class, increasing the cognitive load for the text class developers.</li>
<li>General-purpose design define API only in terms of <b><b>basic</b></b> text features without reflecting the higher-level operations.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Only three methods are needed to modify a text: <code>insert(Position position, String newText)</code>,  <code>delete(Position start, Position end)</code> and <code>changePosition(Position position, int numChars)</code>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The new API uses a more generic <code>Position</code> to replace a specific user interface <code>Cursor</code>.</li>
<li>The delete key can be implemented as <code>text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, 1))</code>, the backspace key can be implemented as <code>text.delete(cursor, text.ChangePosition(cursor, -1))</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The new design is more obvious, e.g., the UI developer knows which character to delete from the interface, and also has less code overall.</li>
<li>The general-purpose methods can also be used for new feature, e.g., search and replace text.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-org17045f2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org17045f2"><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> Layers of abstractions</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Software systems are composed into layers, where higher layers use the facilities provided by lower layers; each layer provides an abstraction different from the layers above or below it.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., a file in the uppermost layer is an array of bytes and is a memory cache of fixed-size disk blocks in the next lower layer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A system contains adjacent layers with similar abstractions is a red flag of class decomposition problem.</li>
<li>The internal representations should be different from the abstractions that appear in the interface; if the interface and the implementation have similar abstractions, the class is shallow.</li>
<li>It is more important for a module to have a simple interface than a simple implementation to benefit more user.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Simple implementation example: throw an exception when don&rsquo;t know how to handle the condition; define configuration parameters (developers should compute reasonable defaults automatically for configuration parameters).</li>
<li>Simple interface example: make a text editor GUI character-oriented rather on line-oriented so users can insert and delete arbitrary ranges of text.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pass-through method is a method that does little except invoke another method, whose signature is similar or identical to the callee function.</li>
<li>Pass-through methods usually indicates there is not a clean <b><b>division of responsibility</b></b> between classes.</li>
<li>Pass-through methods also create dependencies between classes.</li>
<li>The solution is to refactor the classes, e.g., expose the lower level class directly to the higher level (b), redistribute the functionality (c) or merge them (d):</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-7-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A pass-through variable is a variable that is passed down through a long chain of methods.</li>
<li>Pass-through variables add complexity as all intermediate methods must be aware of the existence and need to be modified when a new variable is used.</li>
<li>The author&rsquo;s solution is to introduce a <b><b>context</b></b> object which stores all application&rsquo;s global states, e.g., configuration options and timeout value, and there is one context object per system instance.</li>
<li>To avoid passing through the context variable, a reference to the context can be saved in other objects.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>When a new object is created, the context reference is passed to the constructor.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Dispatcher: a method that uses its arguments to select a specific method to invoke and passes most of its arguments.

</ul></li>
<li>Polymorphous methods, e.g., <code>len(string)</code> and <code>len(array)</code> reduces cognitive load; they are usally in the same layer and do not invoke each other.</li>
<li>Decorator: a wrapper that takes an existing object and extends its functionality.</li>
<li>Decorators are often shallow and contain pass-through methods, one should consider following alternatives before using them:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Add the new functionality directly to the class if it is relatively general-purpose; or merge it with the specific use case if it is specialized.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The goal is to reduce the system complexity as a <b><b>whole</b></b> and improve its modularity.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Subdividing components create additional complexity, e.g. additional code.</li>
<li>Developers should separate one general-purpose code from special-purpose code, each special-purpose code should go in a different module, e.g., pull the special-purpose code into higher layers.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A general-purpose mechanism provides <b><b>interfaces</b></b> for special-purpose code to override.</li>
<li>Each special-purpose code implements particular logic which is unaware by other code, including the general-purpose mechanism.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Combining codes is most beneficial if they are closely related:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>They share information, e.g., HTTP request reader and parser.</li>
<li>They share repeated pattern, e.g., may <code>goto</code> same cleanup code.</li>
<li>The combination simplifies the interface, e.g., each code implement a part of the solution.</li>
<li>They are used together bi-directionally, e.g., a specific error message which is only invoked by one method.</li>
<li>They overlap conceptually in that there is single higher-level category including both code.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each method should do one thing and do it <b><b>completely</b></b>.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The length itself is rarely a good reason for splitting up methods.</li>
<li>If a method is subdivided, users should be able to understand the child method independently, which typically means the child method is relatively general-purpose, otherwise conjoined methods are created.</li>

<h2 id="org2fea587"><span class="section-number-2">9.</span> Exception handling</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-9">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exceptions refer to any uncommon condition that alters the normal control flow.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g., bad arguments, an I/O operation fails, server timeout, packet loss, unprepared condition.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It&rsquo;s difficult to ensure that exception handling code really works, especially in distributed data-intensive systems.</li>
<li>Classes with lots of exceptions have complex interfaces and are shallow.</li>
<li>The best way is to reduce the number of places where exceptions have to be handled.</li>
<li>The author proposes 4 techniques: define errors out of existence; exception handling; exception aggregation; crash.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For errors that are not worth trying to handle, or occur infrequently, abortion is the simplest thing to do; e.g., there is nothing the application can do when an out-of-memory exception occurs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Same as exceptions, special cases can result in code riddled with <code>if</code> statements, they should be eliminated by designing the normal case in a way that automatically handles the special cases.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Example 1: instead of throwing an exception when a key does not exist in <code>remove</code>, simply return to ensure the key no longer exists.</li>
<li>Example 2: instead of throwing an exception when trying to delete a file that is still open in other processes, mark the file for deletion to deny any processes open the old file later, and delete the file after all processed have closed the file.</li>
<li>Example 3: instead of throwing an <code>IndexOutOfBoundsExeception</code> when <code>substring(s, begin, end)</code> takes out-of-range arguments, return the overlap substring.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>An exceptional condition is detected and handled at a low level in the system so that higher levels need not be aware of the condition.</li>
<li>E.g., when a TCP packet is lost, the packet is resent within the implementation and clients are unaware of the dropped packets (they notice the hanging and can abort manually).</li>
<li>Exception masking results in deeper classes and pulls complexity downward.</li>

<h3 id="orgdb1b17b"><span class="section-number-3">9.3.</span> Exception aggregation</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-9-3">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Exception aggregation handles many special-purpose exceptions with a single general-purpose handler.</li>
<li>Example 1: instead of catching the exception for each individual missing parameter, let the single top-level exception handler aggregate the error message with a single <b><b>top-level</b></b> try-catch block.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The top-level handler encapsulates knowledge about how to generate error responses, but knows nothing about specific errors.</li>
<li>Each service knows how to generate errors, but does not know how to send the response.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Example 2: promote rare exceptions (e.g., corrupted files) to more common exceptions (e.g., server crashes) so that the same handler can be used.</li>

<h2 id="org9c416c5"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Previously on my Telegram bot</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
In the post <a href="https://chenyo.me/2024-09-08-build-a-free-telegram-sticker-bot.html">Build a free Telegram sticker tag bot</a>, I detailed the process of integrating various online services to create a sticker tag bot.
After using it for a month, I encountered an intriguing production issue: on one occasion, the inline query result was incomplete.
Interestingly, restarting the Render deployment resolved the problem, though I never fully understood the root cause.
</p>

<p>
Despite this minor hiccup, the sticker tag bot has proven to be reliable most of the time.
However, I found myself not utilizing it as frequently as anticipated.
This was primarily because sending a recent sticker directly is often more convenient than invoking the bot by name.
</p>

<p>
At the conclusion of that post, I hinted at a second functionality I had in mind for the bot: a Mensa bot designed to inform me about the daily offerings at each Mensa (university cafeteria).
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0d7541b" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0d7541b"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Why do I need a Mensa bot</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
One mobile app I frequently use on weekdays is <a href="https://github.com/famoser/Mensa">Mensa</a>, which lists daily menus for each Zürich Mensa to help people make their most important decision of the day.
However, it was merely an inconvenience for myself that the app lacked images of the meals.
I found it difficult to imagine the dishes based solely on the menu descriptions.
To fix this, I decide to add the meal images myself.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8ce79e5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8ce79e5"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How to get the data</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
I couldn&rsquo;t find an official API for this, so I decided to scrape the webpage myself.
Here&rsquo;s where things got tricky: the Mensa web pages use JavaScript to render content.
This meant I couldn&rsquo;t just grab the page - I needed a browser to run the JavaScript first.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org305692d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org305692d"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> Scrape menus locally</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
On a local machine, it&rsquo;s pretty straightforward.
You just grab a scraper library like <a href="https://github.com/go-rod/rod">go-rod</a> and figure out the right API calls.
After you&rsquo;ve snagged the page, you can use an HTML parser like <a href="https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery">goquery</a> to pull out all the menus.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org9b59469" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org9b59469"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> Scrape menus on Render</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
The only snag with <code>go-rod</code> is it&rsquo;s too bulky for a Render free account.
It needs to install Chromium first, but Render&rsquo;s <a href="https://render.com/pricing">512M RAM</a> can&rsquo;t handle that.
I didn&rsquo;t want to hunt for another free host, so <code>go-rod</code> had to go.
</p>

<p>
Claude then pitched the idea of online scraping services.
Most I found were expensive, aimed at heavy-duty scraping.
But I lucked out with <a href="https://app.abstractapi.com/api/scrape/pricing">AbstractAPI</a>, offering 1000 total requests for free.
If I&rsquo;m smart, that could last me about half a year.
<a href="https://docs.scraperapi.com/v/faq/plans-and-billing/free-plan-and-7-day-free-trial">ScraperAPI</a> seemed promising with 1000 monthly free requests.
But it choked on Javascript rendering for my targeted pages even with <code>render=true</code>.
</p>

<p>
AbstractAPI has its quirks too.
The scraped result comes out messy, full of <code>\n</code> and <code>\&amp;#34</code>.
So I had to clean it up before <code>goquery</code> can make sense of it.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org761b316" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org761b316"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> Performance</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
AbstractAPI&rsquo;s free plan only lets you make one request per second.
That&rsquo;s kinda slow when you factor in page rendering and parsing time.
The full HTML page is a whopping 3M, so I&rsquo;ve gotta wait a bit for each bot request.
</p>

<p>
I thought about caching results to cut down on requests.
But here&rsquo;s the thing: menu images usually update right before meal times.
If I didn&rsquo;t catch the image last time, I need the latest scoop.
So, I end up scraping fresh data for each Mensa every single time.

<h2 id="orgab206e1"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
Here&rsquo;s a quick look at what the bot can do now: it tags stickers and scrapes Mensa menus.
Keep in mind the GIF is sped up to twice the normal speed.

<p>
As in the previous post, I aim to demonstrate that while Internet services can be costly, there often remain free solutions for building hobby projects.
This may require more extensive research and additional processing, but it&rsquo;s still feasible.
I hope this continues to be the case in the years to come.

<h2 id="orgd1e133b"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> What happened</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
When I started to use Telegram, I really missed being able to search stickers by text, like I can in WeChat.
Sadly, Telegram only lets you search emojis by text, or find stickers using emojis.
</p>

<p>
After digging around, I discovered the easiest way to add this cool feature was through Telegram bots.
The idea? Store a tag-to-sticker map in the bot, then fetch all matching stickers when given a tag in the bot&rsquo;s <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/inline">inline mode</a>.
There are a few sticker tag bots on Telegram already, but they&rsquo;re either dead or <a href="https://github.com/vitaly-rudenko/tag-sticker-bot">can&rsquo;t handle</a> Unicode input like Chinese characters.
Plus, I&rsquo;m not super keen on trusting my data to someone else&rsquo;s database.
Moreover, I might want to use a bot for other personal stuff later.
</p>

<p>
So, I decided to build my own Telegram bot.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<p>
My goal was to create a bot using only free services, including cloud storage for key-value pairs and a hosting platform to keep the bot running.
</p>

<p>
I stumbled upon <a href="https://render.com">Render</a> from an X recommendation which offers <a href="https://docs.render.com/free#monthly-usage-limits">750 hours per month</a> for free deployment (which equals 31 days), so I deployed my bot there once I got the bot running locally.
But then I found out Render&rsquo;s free tier doesn&rsquo;t offer permanent storage and shuts down services after <a href="https://docs.render.com/free#spinning-down-on-idle">15 minutes of inactivity</a>.
</p>

<p>
A sticker tag bot without memory isn&rsquo;t much use to anyone, so I went hunting for free cloud storage.
With some help from Claude and Perplexity, I discovered <a href="https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/">Firebase Realtime database</a>, which offers 1GB storage and 10GB throughput per month on its <a href="https://firebase.google.com/pricing">free tier</a>.
</p>

<p>
Even with cloud storage, a bot that konks out every 15 minutes just won&rsquo;t cut it - I need my stickers now!
So my next quest was finding a way to keep the bot awake, which led me to <a href="https://uptimerobot.com">UptimeRobot</a>.
It&rsquo;s actually a web monitoring tool, but I can use it to ping the bot regularly, tricking it into staying &ldquo;active&rdquo; instead of dozing off.
</p>

<p>
So, to sum it up, building this sticker tag bot required:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a Telegram bot from <a href="https://t.me/botfather">BotFather</a>,</li>
<li>a free Render deployment,</li>
<li>a Firebase&rsquo;s free key-value storage, and</li>
<li>an UptimeRobot&rsquo;s free monitoring service.</li>
</ul>

<p>
However, these services do not work together automatically. Gluing them together required additional effort.

<h2 id="org8aa667d"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> How to build a bot</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
The first step in building any bot is asking BotFather for a new bot and keeping the bot token secure.
Telegram offers a helpful <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#executing-commands">tutorial</a> that explains the process using Java.
Examples in other languages can be found in their <a href="https://gitlab.com/Athamaxy/telegram-bot-tutorial/-/blob/main/TutorialBot.go">Gitlab repo</a>.
In my opinion, the most challenging part here is creating a unique bot username that is still available.
</p>

<p>
The next step involves working with the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api">Telegram bot API</a> in the chosen programming language.
This includes learning how to handle messages effectively.
For example, I used <a href="https://github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api">tgbotapi(Golang)</a>.

<h3 id="org254b26e"><span class="section-number-3">3.1.</span> How to build a sticker tag bot</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
A sticker tag bot needs two main functionalities:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Handle direct messages to add new sticker tags.</li>
<li>Handle inline queries to search for stickers using a given tag.</li>
</ul>

<p>
To implement the first functionality, I created a simple state machine with two states:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The initial state waits for a sticker input and then moves to the tag state.</li>
<li>The tag state waits for any text input to use as the tag for the previous sticker.</li>
</ol>

<p>
To implement the second functionality, one needs to use the <a href="https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inlinequeryresultcachedsticker">InlineQueryResultCachedSticker</a> method.
</p>

<p>
For local testing, one can use a lightweight local key-value storage to store and search sticker tags.
I used <a href="https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger">BadgerDB(Golang)</a> for example.
</p>

<p>
I noticed that the generated file ID for the same sticker is different each time, making it hard to check for duplicates when adding new tags.
To address this, I added a <code>/delete</code> method to remove tags when needed.

<h3 id="org1286733"><span class="section-number-3">3.2.</span> How to make the bot private</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
I couldn&rsquo;t find an official way to make a bot visible only to me.
Suggested by Claude, I predefined a list of authorized users.
Then I performed a sanity check before handling any messages.

<div id="outline-container-org0dc7c69" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org0dc7c69"><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> How to deploy the bot on Render</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
<p>
Deploying a service on Render with a free account is challenging due to the lack of shell access, disk access, and non-so-live logs.
The process of making everything work at this stage was time-consuming and I even contacted Render&rsquo;s technical support although they only responded &ldquo;Ok I will close the ticket&rdquo; after the issue was self-resolved.
</p>

<p>
Three main steps are required here:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>start an HTTP server with several endpoints at the bot, and</li>
<li>configure the web service and environment variables on Render&rsquo;s dashboard,</li>
<li>configure the <a href="https://blog.domotz.com/product-bytes/telegram-webhook-and-bot-api/">Telegram webhook</a> at the bot.</li>
</ol>

<p>
In step 1, starting an HTTP server at <code>0.0.0.0:&lt;some-port&gt;</code> is necessary.
One should also enable GET methods for the root and a health check endpoint to allow Render to scan the service regularly.
</p>

<p>
In step 2, one needs to fill in the service configuration and environment variables in different boxes.
This includes settings such as port, build command, and health check endpoint.
The issue I encountered was Render could not scan any port even if I have triple-checked that everything worked fine locally.
In the end, I solved this issue by adding the Golang build tag <code>-tags netgo</code> in the build command.
Actually this flag was configured by default, but I initially replaced it with a simpler build command.
</p>

<p>
In step 3, one needs to configure the webhook with the Bot API and to enable the POST method for the webhook at the HTTP server (this can also be handled by the Bot API).
The webhook can be <code>https: //&lt;your project&gt;.onrender.com/&lt;your-token&gt;</code> (or another unique URL).
This URL informs Telegram where to send and receive all messages for the bot.

<h2 id="org5c4479e"><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> How to connect to the Firebase</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
<p>
The Firebase Realtime database stores key-value pairs in the JSON format.
Connecting the bot with the database requires the following steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Create the app and the database on Firebase&rsquo;s dashboard.
Specifically, one needs to store the following 3 values for interaction:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The database URL, which looks like <code>https: //&lt;your-app&gt;-default-rtdb.*.firebasedatabase.app</code>.</li>
<li>The credential file, which can be downloaded at <code>Project settings-&gt;Service accounts-&gt;Firebase Admin SDK</code> (and should also be added to Render).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Import the language-specific Firebase API to configure the database in the bot.
For example, I use <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/firebase.google.com/go/v4">firebase(Golang)</a>.</li>
<li>Update the database rules in Firebase dashboard to only allow authorized writes for specific tags, e.g., one name/path to refer to those key-value pairs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It&rsquo;s worth noting that connecting to the database on Render may take some time after a fresh start.
During this initialization period, the log may display a <code>502 Bad Gateway</code> error to the database.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-6">
<p>
Before configuring UptimeRobot, an attempt was made to ping the bot from within itself, but this approach did not function for Render.
</p>

<p>
Using UptimeRobot to maintain the bot&rsquo;s active status involves two primary steps:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Enable the HEAD method (the sole method available for a free account) for any endpoint on the HTTP server.</li>
<li>Configure an HTTP(S) monitor for that endpoint, which appears as <code>&lt;you-project&gt;.onrender.com/&lt;endpoint&gt;</code>, and establish the monitoring interval to less than 15 minutes.</li>
</ol>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
<p>
This post isn&rsquo;t meant to be a step-by-step guide for building a Telegram bot.
It skips some steps and doesn&rsquo;t include screenshots.
But don&rsquo;t worry, most of the missing bits can be figured out using AI language models these days.
The rest really depends on each specific situation.
The main point here is to show how to set up a free small web service, even when there&rsquo;s no single platform that does it all.
</p>

<p>
When I first wrote this, my bot had been up and running for 10 days.
It only had 30 minutes of downtime, which I think happened because UptimeRobot couldn&rsquo;t reach Render&rsquo;s IP address during that time.
</p>

<p>
Right now, the repository is private since I plan to add a second functionality to the bot soon.
